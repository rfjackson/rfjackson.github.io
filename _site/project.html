    <h1>My Project Idea - EMUrgency</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>EMUrgency is a mobile application that would use the principles of triage to help the public decide whether or not calling for emergency medical help is necessary.  If it is not necessary, it would provide advice around other avenues of appropriate medical care along with easy-to-follow medical advice in different forms.  If it is necessary, the application would include a link to make a phone call to the local emergency services number along with GPS coordinates to help emergency services to locate them in hard to find locations.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>With NSW Ambulance, there have been continued instances of demand outstripping resources in both the answering of 000 calls and responding to incidents with paramedics.  While some of this can be addressed through the increasing of resources by training additional paramedics and calltakers, there is a potential opportunity to divert some of these requests for resources into other channels, like a visit to a GP, pharmacy, or even basic first aid.  While there is already a service called HealthDirect, it is substantially more complicated, and is not necessarily geared to potentially severe situations.  There is also more lead time to access its triage system, and their triage system is more complicated and comprehensive.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The main impetus of the application is not to replace a call to the local emergency services number, but to serve as a quick and easy way to determine the best course of action in the event that the user does not know what to do.  Much like a call to emergency services, it will serve as a place to a quick triage suitable for laypeople, make a safe medical decision based on the information provided by the user, and give basic first aid advice.  The main skeleton of the application, triage, will be quick to open and start with an emphasis on a simple initial interface.  The triage system would use some of the same principles that emergency calltakers use in their jobs on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>On initial setup, the app will run a tutorial to familiarise the user on how the app works, including taking the user through a sample, on-rails demo of a triage.  It will also familiarise the user with the other functions of the app.</p>
<p>Once the tutorial has been completed, the first screen to display on opening a screen with two options - “Help” or “Learn”.  If the user selects “Emergency”, the triage process is started.  Triage consists of an initial category, along with an initial primary survey. Then, unless a triage decision is reached early, it will continue onto a secondary survey.  Each triage question would be designed to be simple and easy to understand by someone who is stressed along with links on keywords in case the user is unable to follow the questions.</p>
<p>Once triage is completed, it will either recommend a call to emergency services, contacting a GP, first aid, or a combination of the three.  If a call to emergency services is recommended, it will have an easy link to immediately dial 000 along with GPS coordinates in case the caller is in a hard to find location.  If first aid is recommended, it will step the user through simple steps with animations and/or voice prompts.</p>
<p>Along with the triage function of the app, it will also have a comprehensive guide on basic first aid that will use some of the same animations and instructions from the triage portion of the app.  It will also have a learning section on how to interact with emergency medical services over the phone.  This part of the app will be gamified with achievements as the user progresses through the lessons in the app.</p>
<p>The initial goal is to have the app involve mainly touch input.  However, high quality voice input may be useful to interact with the app where touch input is not as feasible.  Potential additional features to be added may be identification of nearby landmarks to assist with providing location information and perhaps integration with a medical alarm service with automatic notification to emergency services.</p>
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>To develop on a mobile device, the app would require the use of either Apple’s Xcode or the Android SDK.</p>
<p>To use Xcode, it would require the use of an Apple computer, as Xcode is only available on OS X.  For the iPhone, the primary programming language to be used would be Swift.</p>
<p>The use of Android’s SDK can occur on any platform.  Android does have an official IDE in the form of Android Studio that has inbuilt Andriod development tools, however programming can be done in a variety of IDEs.  For Android, the primary programming language used would be either Java or Kotlin.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of connectivity, the app may need to connect to a server to store data, but is not likely required for the basic functions of the app.</p>
<p>For the graphics, design software and animation software would be required.  For graphic design, software such as Adobe Illustrator or an open-source alternative such as InkScape.</p>
<p>For animation, software such as Adobe Animate or an open-source alternative such as Synfig Studios.</p>
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p> Depending on the initial platform chosen for the project, the development team would need skills in Swift, Java or Kotlin.  Also, knowledge of the relevant APIs for the iPhone and Android would be required.</p>
<p>For the graphics, skills in graphic design and animation would be required.</p>
<p>The knowledge required to build the application would not likely be very high unless it was decided to implement network features.</p>
<p>For the contents of the triage system, we would likely need to consult with medical professionals.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If the app is completed, the result will be a simple to use and a quick to open and start tool to help a potentially stressed user make an initial decision on the best form of help.  Unlike a service such as HealthDirect, it will be focused on speed and simplicity to make a quick decision, which will hopefully lead to a decision much more quickly in the event that it recognises a potentially urgent medical condition.  It would also potentially be applicable to areas without a service such as HealthDirect.  Another outcome desired is further education of the public on first aid to increase response speed to conditions such as severe bleeding and trauma.  Lastly, it is hoped that less serious conditions such as vomiting and minor trauma, are diverted to more appropriate avenues for treatment, saving limited emergency resources for more severe cases.</p>
