<p><i>What do the results of these tests mean to you?</i></p>
<p>As a whole, the tests tell me what I already know of myself: I keep to myself, I like to keep things orderly, and    I like sticking to the facts.  I also tend to learn when I look at things in many different ways.  The MBTI test shows that I am a very steady, serious, and detail-oriented.  The DISC test shows that I prefer to be clear and unambiguous in my communication.  The learning style test indicates that I like to learn through many different modes rather than a single one.</p>
<p><i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i></p>
<p>In terms of behaviour, my introversion would make it more difficult for me to stay in constant communication with my teammates.  I also tend to be less tolerant of getting off task, which may make me seem a bit rigid and a “killjoy”.  Also, I tend to be a bit more out of my element when communication is unambiguous, so I tend to put forth extra effort to ensuring I’m understanding exactly what my team members mean.</p>
<p><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i></p>
<p>In forming a team, I do not feel that I need to take much of it into account as opposed to making it work.  Some of that involves making an effort to be less hung up on rules and staying on task, though this part of my personality may be useful in trying to keep my team on the right path.  It also means that I will likely need to be complemented with someone who is more of an “ideas” person, because I tend to get stuck in the details.</p>
